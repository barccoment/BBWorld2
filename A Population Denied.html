                    With the Republican mindset of today with too many elected officers nonetheless beholden to the insurance lobby our for profit medical insurance policies have best placed this international locations fitness in grave jeopardy. When a international locations health is as sick as ours at the same time as millions of bucks continues flowing into the marketing campaign coffers of our elected officials remains a recipe for catastrophe. It is a recognized fact that america spends billions of dollars in fitness care but, is with the aid of far one of the least healthiest country. The loss of life care policies of today has most effective shortened life spans for each males and females. Other countries especially Sweden or Norway have one of the healthiest populations inside the global and spend some distance less than the US.

                <p>It is unconscionable that millions of Americans keep to languish in dire need of medical or dental care. Health care that no longer most effective would greatly add to the great of life however could produce monetary effects beneficial to the stableness and boom of this country. Too frequently a bill has come earlier than Congress that outlines Universal Health Care. From Truman to Ted Kennedy the passage of Universal Health Care that they so valiantly attempted to bypass died a tragic dying at the flooring of Congress. When Obama handed the Affordable Health Care Act in 2010 was a small step within the proper direction however did not safely offer health insurance for all Americans. All that bill did changed into fatten the coverage groups wallets at the same time as depleting what ever disposable earning too many Americans have.

               <p class ="posts">The travesty in America nowadays is that our elected officers now not see themselves as employees of the public however see the public as their personnel. And, as such the public continues to be denied the opportunities to steer richer and fuller lives. When the soap opera within the White House subsequently reaches the final act, I wish very soon, makes it critical that Congress passes Senator Sanders Medicare For All, a Universal Health Care bill.
